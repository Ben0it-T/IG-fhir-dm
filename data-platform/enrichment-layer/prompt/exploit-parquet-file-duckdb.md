<goal>
Implement a solution to exploit parquet files after Pathling export with DuckDB.
</goal>

<instructions>
- EXPLORE and THINK about the project to understand what you need in order to complete the task. Read all the files that are USEFUL for your task. You explore as `search-specialist` agent the PARQUET format and DuckDB database to an analytic solution.
- PLAN precisely which actions you need to take to accomplish the task. Clearly define each step to achieve a clean and maintainable result.
- You should as `python-pro` agent follow the plan exactly, focusing only on the requested task.
- You should as `debugger` agent TEST by applying an iterative approach: run script to tests, fix the detected errors, then rerun script. Repeat this process until the entire result executes with a 100% success rate.

<recommandations>
- Your working directory is `data-platform/eds/analytic`.
- You should use last release of DuckDB.
- You should allow to config input/output files directory.
</recommandations>

<output>
A well-defined Python project that loads parquet data into DuckDB database and tests with some SQL queries.
